This program coded in Python, is used to find out the root of a simple transcendental equation(x^4 -x -10=0).The precision of the obtained root is set to four decimals.It shows us the number of iterations taken by each method.
The guess values/ranges of the functions are predefined.
The following numerical methods are used in the program:
1.Bisection Method
2.Newton Raphson Method
3.Simple Fixed Point Iteration
4.Secant Method
5.Regula Falsi/False Position Method
